Changes: 

Toilet Table insert format date like - 03-MAR-2020 instead of 03/03/2020
Catering tables - Keep everything on one line, oracle isn't good enough to understand
Users_TB - Password field needed.
Changed booking duration to number as a quick fix, change this back to timestamp and match bookings_start format


I have tried to re make the ERD but i keep screwing it up 
- what i wanted to change is in building and room we have catering as a foreign key so what do you suggest

Don't worry about it, not all building/room will have a catering_id. 

- the toilet sitution i have noted yes as 1 no as 2 but im not sure how to show both male and female its quite confusing -

Both = 0
Male = 1
Female = 2
