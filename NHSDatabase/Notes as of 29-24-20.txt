Created a password field of VARCHAR2(60) to account for BCRYPT encrpytion length.

Changed the ID's in buildings, users and reviews table to 'GENERATED BY DEFAULT ON NULL AS IDENTITY' this will generate a unique number if we do not specify a number and instead pass a null value.

Added a generic password for all users.

Ernest notes: 
Usernames in the users_tb need to be easier for debug purposes, maybe just concatenate the users first and last name
All emails need to be changed to gmail, these could just be 'username'@gmail.com.
