I have tried to re make the ERD but i keep screwing it up 
- what i wanted to change is in building and room we have catering as a foreign key so what do you suggest
Don't worry about it, not all building/room will have a catering_id. 

- the toilet sitution i have noted yes as 1 no as 2 but im not sure how to show both male and female its quite confusing -
Both = 0
Male = 1
Female = 2
